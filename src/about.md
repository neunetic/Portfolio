    <h2>Hello! I'm Suhayb </h2>
    <p>I am an illustrator and visual artist with a passion for creating vibrant and imaginative worlds. My work is heavily inspired by fantasy, mythology, and the surreal beauty of the natural world.</p>
    <p>From a young age, I was always drawing. What started as a hobby quickly grew into a lifelong dedication to the craft. I specialize in digital illustration, using tools like Procreate and Adobe Photoshop to bring my ideas to life. My style is characterized by detailed line work, rich textures, and a dynamic use of color.</p>
    <p>Whether it's for a book cover, a game concept, or a personal commission, my goal is always the same: to tell a story and evoke emotion through my art. When I'm not drawing, you can usually find me exploring a forest, reading a good book, or playing video games (for research, of course!).</p>
    <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. If you're interested in collaborating or commissioning a piece, feel free to get in touch!</p>
