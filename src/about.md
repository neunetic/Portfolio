    <h3>Hello! I'm Suhayb </h3>
    <p>I am an illustrator, comic artist and character designer currently based in Norway. I specialize in characters. I'm a designer and storyteller at heart and a constant sketcher. In my free time I read old fiction literature, play soulslike games or watch movies. </p>
    <p>If I am to define my artistic philosophy, it's that the essence of beauty is found in something that has history. The weary lines on a old king's face, a broken vase repaired with gold, the young prince missing an eye. Essentially it's transience. The reminder that time passes. It's in the metamorphosis when we face our fears and become different people, wearing our history on our sleeves. </p>
